Hello, I'm Benjamin Symanowicz and this is a curated mirror of select projects for consumption by prospective employers. I also use this account for collaboration with other github users/orgs. Please do not post issues/pull requests to these projects as I do not monitor this site. For more code and/or to contribute, please check out my [personal site](https://ben.symanowicz.com)

Most of my projects are in [Go](https://go.dev) as I've found it interesting as a "Better C, from the makers of C." I've also done work in Python, and once upon a time .NET. Occasionally I fiddle with esoteric operating systems.
